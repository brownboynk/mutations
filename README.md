# Mutation Testing Report for Polynomial Class

## Introduction

Mutation testing is a technique for evaluating the effectiveness of a test suite by introducing small changes (mutations) to the code and examining whether the tests can detect these changes. In this report, we applied mutation testing to the `Polynomial` class and its associated test suite.

## List of Defined Mutation Operators

### 1. Change Coefficient

- **Description:** Mutate the coefficients of the polynomial by changing their values.

### 2. Modify Arithmetic Operations 

- **Description:** Mutate arithmetic operations within the polynomial evaluation.

### 3. Introduce Redundant Code

- **Description:** Add redundant or unnecessary code to the polynomial class.

### 4. Remove Arithmetic Operations

- **Description:** Remove certain arithmetic operations from the polynomial evaluation.

## Description of Applied Mutations and Their Impact

We applied the defined mutation operators to the `Polynomial` class, creating mutated versions of the code. The impact of each mutation was assessed by running the test suite against the mutated code. Here are examples of applied mutations:

### Mutation 1: Change Coefficient

- **Original Code:** `poly1 = Polynomial([3, 0, 2])`

- **Mutated Code:** `poly1 = Polynomial([5, 0, 2])` 

- **Impact:** Survived, as the test suite did not detect the change in coefficients.

### Mutation 2: Modify Arithmetic Operations

- **Original Code:** `result_coefficients = [a + b for a, b in zip(padded_self, padded_other)]`

- **Mutated Code:** `result_coefficients = [a - b for a, b in zip(padded_self, padded_other)]`

- **Impact:** Killed, as the test suite correctly identified the modification.

### Mutation 3: Introduce Redundant Code

- **Original Code:** `if coef == 0: continue`

- **Mutated Code:** `if coef == 0: result += 0`

- **Impact:** Survived, as the test suite did not detect the redundant code.

### Mutation 4: Remove Arithmetic Operations

- **Original Code:** `result += coef * (x ** (len(self.coefficients) - i - 1))`

- **Mutated Code:** `result = coef * (x ** (len(self.coefficients) - i - 1))`

- **Impact:** Survived, as the test suite did not detect the removed operation.

## Summary of Mutant Survival and Killing

- **Survived Mutants:** 75%
- **Killed Mutants:** 25%

## Analysis of the Test Suite's Effectiveness

The test suite demonstrated effectiveness in detecting mutations related to arithmetic operations but showed weaknesses in identifying changes in coefficients and redundant code. The detection rate was affected by the complexity of the mutations.

## Recommendations for Improving the Test Suite

1. **Strengthen Coefficient Mutation Detection:**

   - Enhance test cases specifically targeting changes in coefficients.

2. **Refine Redundant Code Detection:**

   - Strengthen test cases to better detect the introduction of redundant code.
   
3. **Consider Additional Test Cases:**

   - Identify and add test cases for edge cases and boundary conditions.
   
4. **Diversify Mutation Types:**

   - Introduce more diverse mutation types to challenge the test suite.
   
## Conclusion

Mutation testing provided valuable insights into the test suite's effectiveness for the `Polynomial` class. By addressing the identified weaknesses and enhancing the test suite, developers can improve the overall robustness of the testing process, ensuring a higher degree of mutation detection.
